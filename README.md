# Gmail-stats

Provide analytics based on your gmail activity. Scan your entire emails archive
and shown most frequest email senders.

## Quickstart

To run this application you need to get a Client Id for Google API. You can get
one at https://console.developers.google.com/.

## Disclaimer

As I realized after implementation was finished, Gmail API isn't the best tool
for such application. There is strict limitations which are hard to bypass and
although Gmail API is great it's still worse than IMAP for this task. I keep
this script as is for future reconstruction.
